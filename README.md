plotVisualizer.m
plotVisualizer.fig
The main files this repository contains are plotVisualizer.m and plotVisualizer.fig. The latter represents the actual GUI
where all the options to analyze the videos described in the Report can be accessed. To run the GUI, type guide(plotVisualizer)
in MATLAB, which opens a window where the GUI can be changed. Only when this window is open as well, can the GUI function.
I tried to fix this bug, but was unable to.
