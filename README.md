The most important files here are are plotVisualizer.m and plotVisualizer.fig, the latter being the GUI. To be able to use the GUI, type "guide(plotVisualizer)" in MATLAB which will open up a window that enables changes to the GUI.

For some reason, only after doing this, is the GUI operational. I tried fixing this bug but was unable to.

There are 7 data files that store the sensing graphs using different models (360 degrees, 180 degrees with radius, and the circle intersection model). These are used when comparing different properties between sensing graphs.
